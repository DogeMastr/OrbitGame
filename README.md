# OrbitGame
Basicly the game OrbitXL from <a href=https://www.nickervision.com>nickervision</a> 

You use the mouse buttons to move away from the blackhole (Black dot in the center) and let go to move towards it

You get points by getting a near miss with an asteroid and finishing one full *orbit* around the blackhole

To run the game (as im not finished with it yet) you would need to have the <a href =https://processing.org/download>processing IDE that you can download here<a> you can download the master and just open it up with that 
  
  ***It should work***

Stuff I know dosen't work:
 - Highscores with names
